***In Short:** In some regions, such as the EEA, UK, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.*

In some regions (like the EEA, UK, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right to:

- Request access and obtain a copy of your personal information
- Request rectification or erasure
- Restrict the processing of your personal data
- Data portability in certain circumstances
- Object to processing

You can exercise these rights by contacting us using the contact details provided in the "How Can You Contact Us About This Notice?" section below.

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html).

### Withdrawing your consent

If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section **"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"** below.

However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

### Opting out of marketing and promotional communications

You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section **"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"** below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.

If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at support@cva.design.
